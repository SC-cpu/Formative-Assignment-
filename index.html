<h1>Google Maps</h1>
<p class="monospace">Who hasn't gotten lost in a new city? Or wanted to make sure they knew exactly how long it took to get to their new place of work?
We've all been there, and that's why Google maps is so indispensible to each of us. Provinding information on not just how many miles or kilometeres
a location is away from us, but also transport links, possible traffic distruptions and which roads are dangerous to walk down because of
traffic. It's fair to say that Google Maps has stopped me being late more than a handful of times. Going to the Consumer information
area of Google Maps will also inform you of the fact that user reviews are sometimes listed on Maps, giving consumers info on the best places to 
eat or the best hotels to stay! We're lucky to have this convenience.</p>
</div>
<p>Overall, we can see that Google Maps has provided:
<ul>
  <li>Convenience</li>
  <li>Accesibility</li>
  <li>Knowledge of local transport and walking routes</li>
  <li>Reviews on the best places to visit in an area</li>
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-danger">Info</button>
</ul>
